[![javadoc](https://javadoc.io/badge2/net.e175.klaus/solarpositioning/javadoc.svg)](https://javadoc.io/doc/net.e175.klaus/solarpositioning)

A Java library for finding topocentric solar coordinates, i.e. the sun’s position on the sky for a given date,
latitude, and longitude (and other parameters), as well as times of sunrise and sunset. Calculations strictly follow
well-known, peer-reviewed algorithms: [SPA](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2003.12.003) by Reda and Andreas and,
alternatively, [Grena/ENEA](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2012.01.024) by Grena. More than 1000 test points are
included to validate against the reference code and other sources.

## Usage

### Maven coordinates

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.e175.klaus</groupId>
    <artifactId>solarpositioning</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.8</version>
</dependency>
```

### Requirements

Java 17 or newer. No additional runtime dependencies.

### Code

The API is intentionally "flat", comprising a handful of static methods and simple records as results.
To get refraction-corrected topocentric coordinates:

```java
var dateTime = new ZonedDateTime.now();

// replace SPA with Grena3 as needed
var position = SPA.calculateSolarPosition(
    dateTime,
    48.21, // latitude (degrees)
    16.37, // longitude (degrees)
    190, // elevation (m)
    DeltaT.estimate(dateTime.toLocalDate()), // delta T (s)
    1010, // avg. air pressure (hPa)
    11); // avg. air temperature (°C)

System.out.println(position);
```

The SPA class includes methods to calculate the times of sunrise, sun transit, and sunset in one fell swoop. The actual 
return type depends on the type of day (regular day, polar day, polar night).

```java
var result=SPA.calculateSunriseTransitSet(
        dateTime,
        70.978, // latitude  
        25.974, // longitude
        69); // delta T

if(result instanceof SunriseResult.RegularDay regular) {
    System.out.println(regular);
} else {
    System.out.println("no sunrise or sunset today!");    
}
```

Twilight start and end times can be obtained like sunrise and sunset, but assuming a different horizon:

```java
var result=SPA.calculateSunriseTransitSet(
        dateTime,
        70.978, // latitude  
        25.974, // longitude
        69, // delta T
        SPA.Horizon.CIVIL_TWILIGHT); 
```

For bulk position processing at a fixed time with many coordinates using SPA, use the optimized split methods for significantly better performance:

```java
// Compute time-dependent parts once
final var timeDependent = SPA.calculateSpaTimeDependentParts(dateTime, deltaT);

// Reuse for multiple coordinates (up to 10x faster)
for(var coordinate: coordinates) {
    var position = SPA.calculateSolarPositionWithTimeDependentParts(
        dateTime, coordinate.lat, coordinate.lon, coordinate.elevation, timeDependent);
}
```
See the Javadoc for more methods.

### Which position algorithm should I use?

* For many applications, Grena3 should work just fine. It's simple, fast, and pretty accurate for a time window from
  2010 to 2110 CE.
* If you're looking for maximum accuracy or need to calculate for historic dates, use SPA. It's widely considered a
  reference algorithm for solar positioning, being very accurate and usable in a very large time window.

While Grena3 is about an order of magnitude faster than SPA, in absolute terms we are talking about microseconds. The difference
mostly matters for bulk calculations.

### Notes on sunrise, sunset, and twilight

* Calculation is based on the usual correction of 0.833° on the zenith angle, i.e. sunrise and sunset are assumed to
  occur when the center of the solar disc is 50 arc-minutes below the horizon. While commonly used, this fixed value
  fails to account for the varying effects of atmospheric refraction. Calculated and apparent sunrise and sunset times
  may easily differ by several minutes (cf. [Wilson 2018](https://doi.org/10.37099/mtu.dc.etdr/697)).
* As a general note on accuracy, Jean Meeus advises that "giving rising or setting times .. more accurately than to the
  nearest minute makes no sense" (_Astronomical Algorithms_). Errors increase the farther the position from the equator,
  i.e. values for polar regions are much less reliable.
* The SPA sunset/sunrise algorithm is one of the most accurate ones around. Results of this implementation correspond
  very closely to the [NOAA calculator](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/)'s.

### What's this "delta T" thing?

See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ΔT_(timekeeping)) for an explanation. For many simple applications, and particularly for sunrise and sunset,
this value could be negligible as it's just over a minute (about 70 seconds) as of this writing. However, if you're 
looking for maximum accuracy, you should use an observed value (available from e.g. the US Naval 
Observatory) or at least a solid estimate.

The DeltaT class provides an estimator based on polynomials fitting a number of observed (or extrapolated) historical
values, published by [Espenak and Meeus](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/deltatpoly.html) in 2007 and slightly updated by [Espenak](https://www.eclipsewise.com/help/deltatpoly2014.html) in 2014.

As of 2025, it appears that today's extrapolated values from this estimator are a little too high (some 2 seconds). This gap
will widen in the coming decades (cf. [Morrison et al. 2021](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2020.0776)). 
Still, the estimates should work sufficiently well for most applications.

### Is it thread-safe?

Yes. None of the classes hold any mutable shared state.
